# üß† Mental Health Conversations Topic Modeling

This project explores topic modeling on mental health conversation data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic.
The dataset is sourced from Psychika Dataset
, which contains Indonesian conversational text related to psychology and mental health.

## üìÇ Dataset

`Source:` (Psychika Dataset (Kaggle))[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xmaulana/psychikadataset-7b/data]

Contains Indonesian conversational text regarding **mental health, psychology, and counseling.**

## üîç Methods

I applied two topic modeling approaches:

**1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

- Preprocessing with tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization.
- Bag-of-Words representation via CountVectorizer.
- Extracted 10 top keywords per topic.

**2. BERTopic**

- Transformer-based topic modeling.
- Used embeddings from a pre-trained Indonesian language model.
- More coherent and semantically meaningful topics compared to LDA.

Visualized with interactive BERTopic visualization tools.
